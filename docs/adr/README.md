# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) documenting significant technical decisions made in the Devbox project.

## What are ADRs?

ADRs capture important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. They help:

- New contributors understand why things are the way they are
- Future maintainers make informed decisions about changes
- Track the evolution of the architecture over time
